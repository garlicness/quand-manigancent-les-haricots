# Contributing

The first way to contribute would be to read the [novel](https://github.com/garlicness/quand-manigancent-les-haricots/releases/latest).
Any feedbacks are welcome.

You can also report typos and non-senses, I'm sure there is plenty. I guess an issue would be a proper way to do it.

Pull requests and forks are also available if you fancy.

Thanks!
